**Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on the use of machine learning techniques to detect exoplanets. Leveraging data from NASA's Kepler Mission, which includes light curves representing the brightness of stars over time, we aim to automate the identification of exoplanets. Traditional methods for detecting exoplanets, such as the transit method, require extensive human analysis. This project addresses the challenge of processing large datasets generated by modern technology and aims to reduce the need for human intervention.

**Key Features**
1. **Data Collection:** Utilizes light curves data from NASA's Kepler Mission.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducts initial analysis to understand the dataset.
3. **Baseline Machine Learning Models:** Applies initial models to detect exoplanets.
4. **Data Imbalance Handling:** Implements SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
5. **Performance Improvement:** Reapplies machine learning models post-SMOTE to achieve better results.
6. **Performance Metrics:** Compares results using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC, and Area Under the Curve (AUC).
